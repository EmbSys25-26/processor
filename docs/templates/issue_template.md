## Issues

Create an issue for each task to be assigned to a member / group of members. Each issue should clearly state:

- The type of task assigned;
- The content of the task, what it requests;
- The DoD (Definition Of Done) for each task.

## Conventions

Issue naming convention: `<type>/<description>`

Examples:

- `pipeline/ add IF/ID stage register + valid`
- `pipeline/ add ID/EX stage register + control signals`
- `compiler/ add flex grammar ruleset`
- `compiler/ add bison grammar ruleset`
- `peripherals/ add I2C peripheral`
- `peripherals/ add VGA peripheral`
